  ╭───────────────────────────────────────╮
  
  The Dragon is dead. The world is saved.\
  But after the war is over, what was left to fight for?\
  The hero's heart was tired.\
  So the hero sought a different kind of prize.\
  Not a dragon's hoard, but something more valuable.\
  A home.\
  A peaceful end.\
  To watch the crops grow.\
  To build a world that wasn't just safe, but beaufitul.\
  And find that the greatest adventure had just begun.\
